These are going to be the first deliverable

Given a situation they apply conditions to it, and fetch relevant data. 


# Example
* Show me the health of the service in each environment
* Show me the git commit difference between each environment and the production environment
* Show me the information about this user in all the 'login' tables across the environments and services
  * For example 'why can't the user login'
* Show me bad data about this topic

A lot of this can also be done by metrics and if they exist we just use them.
